# OpenClaw Improvement Specification (Derived from claw-code Analysis)

## Status
Plan/specification only. **No implementation changes** included.

## Objective
Analyze the `claw-code` repository as a Claude-code-style harness mirror and extract practical improvements for **OpenClaw** (features, skills, functionality, agent architecture) that are compatible with OpenClaw’s current documented design.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

The `claw-code` codebase currently functions as a **high-fidelity inventory + simulation scaffold**:

- Broad mirrored command/tool surfaces via snapshots (207 command entries, 184 tool entries).
- Good CLI exploration/reporting scaffolding.
- Limited real runtime semantics (many placeholder/simulated handlers).

This is useful for OpenClaw because it highlights what a large harness inventory needs beyond baseline functionality:

1. canonical identity and deduping for huge command/tool surfaces
2. deterministic routing and explainability
3. strict parity governance (metadata → dry-run → active runtime)
4. mode contract testing (remote/ssh/teleport/etc.)
5. richer adapter lifecycle and policy visibility

OpenClaw already has many mature primitives (agent loop, streaming lifecycle, transcript hygiene, compaction, hooks, multi-agent/delegation). The opportunity is to add **migration-grade observability and adapter ergonomics** so OpenClaw can absorb larger tool ecosystems with less ambiguity and better safety posture.

---

## 2) What Was Observed in claw-code (Relevant Signals)

## 2.1 Inventory-first architecture

- `commands_snapshot.json` and `tools_snapshot.json` drive command/tool catalogs.
- Command/tool execution shims frequently return “mirrored ... would handle ...” messages.
- Many subsystem packages are placeholder metadata wrappers.

### Why this matters for OpenClaw
OpenClaw can benefit from a stronger “inventory governance” layer whenever importing third-party skills/tools or mirroring external ecosystems.

## 2.2 Duplicate-name pressure in large surfaces

Observed from snapshots:

- Commands: 207 total, 141 unique names (high duplicate display-name rate).
- Tools: 184 total, 94 unique names; heavy repeated generic names (`prompt`, `UI`, `constants`).

### Why this matters for OpenClaw
As tool/plugin ecosystems scale, name collisions become common. Name-only routing/lookup quickly gets brittle.

## 2.3 Placeholder mode handlers

Runtime mode handlers in claw-code (`remote/ssh/teleport/direct/deep-link`) are mostly placeholders.

### Why this matters for OpenClaw
OpenClaw already has real agent-loop machinery and runtime queues. Codifying mode contracts and diagnostics can prevent future regressions and improve operator confidence.

## 2.4 Parity audit pattern (good idea, incomplete execution)

claw-code has parity audit concepts but weak fallback behavior when local archive is missing.

### Why this matters for OpenClaw
OpenClaw can adopt the **parity-level pattern** for optional features/skills/providers, turning “supported/not supported” into measurable maturity bands.

---

## 3) OpenClaw Baseline Strengths (from docs)

OpenClaw documentation indicates these strong foundations already exist:

- Serialized agent loop + lifecycle streams + wait semantics.
- Queue lanes and per-session consistency guarantees.
- Transcript hygiene and provider-specific sanitization rules.
- Session compaction + pre-compaction memory flush.
- Multi-agent/delegate architecture with policy boundaries.
- Internal/plugin hooks at key lifecycle points.

Therefore this spec does **not** propose replacing core OpenClaw architecture; it proposes additive improvements on top.

---

## 4) Proposed Improvement Tracks for OpenClaw

## Track A — Canonical Tool/Command Identity Layer

### Problem
Human-readable names are not globally unique in large ecosystems.

### Proposal
Add canonical identity metadata for command/tool registry entries:

- `id` (stable unique, namespaced)
- `displayName`
- `namespace` (core/plugin/skill/provider/local)
- `version` or source digest
- `capabilityClass` (read, write, execute, network, messaging, scheduling)

### Outcomes
- deterministic lookup
- collision-safe routing
- better audit trails

### Acceptance Criteria
- Registry rejects identity collisions on `id`.
- Routing, status, and diagnostics surfaces expose canonical IDs.
- Legacy name-based lookup remains available but warns on ambiguity.

---

## Track B — Route Explainability & Benchmarking

### Problem
When tool surfaces grow, misrouting is expensive and hard to debug.

### Proposal
Introduce a route explainability format and benchmark set:

- exact-match / alias / semantic / policy-prior signals
- per-candidate score breakdown
- top-k with rationale
- offline benchmark suite for regression testing

### Outcomes
- easier debugging
- measurable route quality over releases

### Acceptance Criteria
- `route --explain`-style output in internal diagnostics.
- Stable benchmark corpus committed in docs/test assets.
- Route quality gates in CI for critical intents.

---

## Track C — Adapter Maturity Levels (Parity Rubric)

### Problem
Binary “exists vs works” hides real maturity.

### Proposal
Adopt parity/maturity levels for tools/commands/skills:

- **L0**: discoverable metadata
- **L1**: schema-validated + listed
- **L2**: dry-run semantics + policy checks
- **L3**: active runtime support in controlled scope
- **L4**: production-hardened (telemetry + replay confidence)

### Outcomes
- honest capability reporting
- clearer roadmap for contributors

### Acceptance Criteria
- machine-readable maturity report artifact
- docs-generated capability tables from artifact
- every non-experimental tool tagged with maturity level

---

## Track D — Policy Decision Traceability

### Problem
Users and operators need “why blocked/allowed” answers with reproducible logic.

### Proposal
Extend policy decision logging with structured reason codes:

- capability denied
- namespace denied
- risk-tier denied
- missing approval context
- channel-policy conflict

### Outcomes
- easier compliance reviews
- faster support/debug

### Acceptance Criteria
- every blocked tool call includes reason code + policy source pointer
- lifecycle stream can emit policy decision events in verbose/debug mode

---

## Track E — Mode Contract Test Matrix

### Problem
Mode complexity (direct/remote/node/acp/session orchestration) risks drift without explicit contracts.

### Proposal
Define mode contracts and required test cases:

- connect/auth/health/teardown states
- timeout/retry behavior
- error taxonomy (auth, network, policy, runtime)
- deterministic user-facing failure messages

### Outcomes
- higher reliability across environments
- easier incident triage

### Acceptance Criteria
- contract tests per mode path
- standardized failure envelope used by CLI + chat-facing surfaces

---

## Track F — Skill Vetting + Runtime Trust Labels

### Problem
Open skill ecosystems need safety transparency and runtime trust context.

### Proposal
Integrate trust labels for skill/tool origin and vetting state:

- source: core | first-party | community | local
- vetting: unreviewed | reviewed | verified
- requested capabilities summary

### Outcomes
- safer install/use workflows
- clearer operator decisions

### Acceptance Criteria
- install/enable flow surfaces trust label + capability scope
- policy can require reviewed/verified for certain capability classes

---

## Track G — Session Event Journal Facade (Optional, additive)

### Problem
Complex runs benefit from a concise event timeline separate from raw transcript details.

### Proposal
Add optional normalized event-journal export for diagnostics:

- message_in
- route_selected
- tool_call_start/end
- policy_decision
- compaction_start/end
- memory_flush

### Outcomes
- easier replay/debug
- better observability dashboards

### Acceptance Criteria
- export endpoint/CLI path for journal view
- correlation IDs tie journal events to transcript entries

---

## 5) OpenClaw-Specific High-Impact Candidates (First Iteration)

1. **Canonical ID + ambiguity warning layer** for command/tool registries.
2. **Routing explainability diagnostics** with score decomposition.
3. **Maturity report artifact** for tools/skills/features in docs/CI.
4. **Policy reason-code surfacing** in debug/verbose streams.

These four deliver high operational value without destabilizing existing loop/runtime design.

---

## 6) Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Added metadata complexity burdens maintainers.
  **Mitigation:** auto-generate most fields where possible; require minimal mandatory fields.

- **Risk:** Explainability data leaks internals by default.
  **Mitigation:** gate detailed traces behind debug/verbose and redact sensitive values.

- **Risk:** Maturity labels become stale.
  **Mitigation:** tie labels to CI checks and contract-test pass criteria.

- **Risk:** Policy reason codes diverge from actual enforcement path.
  **Mitigation:** reason emitted only from enforcement engine, not wrappers.

---
